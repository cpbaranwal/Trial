I have given a Long Sentence and some words(to be searched in the sentence), 
i have to find the smallest part of the sentence which contains all the words to be Searched
 in that Sentence and print that part.

I have tried it, 1. First get all locations(indexes) of all words from the given sentence.
2. then try to find smallest part from these indexes of words.

But i am having problem implementing 2nd part . 
So i want some advice for it or if you suggest any other algorithm which can make it fast.
Example: If i have a String > "Hello, my name is undefined. but your name is not undefined." 
and i have to search word [is, undefined] then the answer should be printed is: is undefined 
//which is taken from the sentence 1st and we can not print from second sentence as it is
 *  " is not undefined" because it is not shortest.

		List<String> lst=new ArrayList<String>();
		String[] arr=lst.toArray(new String[0]);

	}

}
